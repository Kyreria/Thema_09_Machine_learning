After acquiring the data from the database, it was time to import the data to see if there were any inconsistencies.

```{r import_data}
# Make sure the working directory is the main folder containing all the folders (project folder).
# This is to make sure the working directory is on the main folder containing everything.
working_directory <- getwd()
# get the directory for the data_files
bcel_data <- read.csv("./Data/input_bcell.csv", header = TRUE)
sars_data <- read.csv("./Data/input_sars.csv", header = TRUE)
covid_data <- read.csv("./Data/input_covid.csv", header = TRUE)

pander(head(bcel_data))
pander(head(sars_data))
pander(head(covid_data))
```
